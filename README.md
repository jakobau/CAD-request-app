# CAD-request-app
Web app for creating and managing 3D CAD design requests.

What is the 3D Design Request Manager web app?
This app is used to help manage the 3D design requests to NexTech volunteer 3D printing hosts. Students/users can “request” a 3D design to be printed and they will be notified via email or sms when their request is ready for pickup. Hosts can login, see pending requests in their area, accept requests, and mark requests ready for pickup. 

Extra: Students/users can look up their request with the request ID and see progress.
